![Africa's Awakening](images/africa.png)

Africa is undergoing profound change. Long viewed mainly through the lens of crisis and poverty, the continent is increasingly perceived as a dynamic engine of growth, a technological driver, and an innovative actor in the global system. Yet this awakening is multi-layered: alongside impressive economic successes, serious structural deficits persist. This essay highlights the central aspects of this development across the themes of growth, digitalisation, industry, energy, culture, and structural challenges.

### 1. Growth: The Continent of the Future

Africa today is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, including Niger, Senegal, Rwanda and Côte d’Ivoire. This growth is powered by a young, dynamic population—over 60 percent of Africans are under 25. Digitalisation and the rise of new consumer markets provide additional stimulus. Mobile internet use in Africa climbed from around 28 percent in 2019 to approximately 38 percent in 2024, reflecting the continent’s steady progress in digital inclusion and its active role in shaping its future.

The demographic momentum is striking: Africa’s median age is 19, compared with Europe’s 42. This youthful energy fuels labour-market dynamism, consumer spending, and a booming entrepreneurial climate. In Nigeria alone, more than 500,000 tech-savvy graduates enter the labour market each year, while Africa’s consumer expenditures reached US $2.1 trillion in 2024. The start-up scene is flourishing as well: 63 percent of the US $8.3 billion in tech funding went to founders under 35.

Nevertheless, growth remains unevenly distributed. Each year 12 million young people join the labour force, but only about 3 million formal jobs are created. Programmes such as Ethiopia’s Jobs Creation Commission and South Africa’s Youth Employment Service seek to close that gap.

### 2. Digitalisation as a Key Factor

Digitalisation represents one of Africa’s greatest opportunities. Kenya’s “Silicon Savannah,” Egypt and Morocco are investing heavily in IT infrastructure, smart cities, and e-government. Africa’s digital economy is valued at US $180 billion in 2024 and is expanding three times faster than the global average. 4G networks now cover 75 percent of Sub-Saharan Africans, and 5G is live in 18 major cities.

Fintech, in particular, is a growth engine: mobile-money transactions reached US $1.2 trillion in 2024. Innovations in agriculture, health and education are transforming the continent and letting millions benefit directly from digital technologies.

Start-up hubs such as Nairobi and Accra are booming. Initiatives like Bosch innovation centres in South Africa and Kenya support local tech entrepreneurs and advance IoT solutions tailored to African contexts. Other large technology companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have also invested heavily. Microsoft has opened several development centers, including in Nairobi and Lagos, to train and promote African talent. Google supports numerous young tech companies through its “Google for Startups Accelerator Africa” program. AWS opened a cloud region in South Africa in 2020 to further drive the digitalization of African companies. These investments show the growing confidence in Africa's digital future.

### 3. Industry and Infrastructure: From Raw-Material Exports to Value Creation

Africa is charting a bold new course of economic transformation — with the automotive industry accelerating rapidly in dynamic hubs across the continent: South Africa remains the centre, Morocco is becoming an export platform to Europe, and Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria are expanding local assembly and production. Companies such as Bosch, Siemens, Volkswagen, Huawei, Stellantis, Renault-Nissan and BYD are making targeted investments in local networks, automation, electromobility and smart manufacturing. For example, Volkswagen has a modern assembly plant in Rwanda, Huawei is supporting the expansion of 5G and digital education on the continent, and Siemens is involved in industrial automation and energy infrastructure in several African countries. These developments are helping to anchor technological expertise and industrial value creation on the continent in the long term.

Governments are also ramping up modern infrastructure projects. Smart cities like Eko Atlantic in Nigeria and Egypt’s New Administrative Capital exemplify urban developments designed to strengthen domestic value chains and national control.

### 4. Renewable Energy and Climate Sensitivity

Africa is setting impressive standards in the energy sector. The Noor Solar Complex in Morocco, one of the largest solar power plants in the world, symbolizes Africa's ambitions in the field of green energy. Egypt's Benban Solar Park (1.65 GW), Kenya's Garissa Solar Plant and South Africa's Jasper project are further flagship projects. Morocco, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya are investing heavily in solar, wind and hydropower, thereby contributing to the global energy transition.

The solar sector is developing particularly dynamically. According to the Global Solar Council, Africa's annual solar capacity is expected to increase by 42% in 2025¹ - a sharp rise after a period of delay. Around 23 GW of new solar capacity could be installed by 2028 - almost double the current total capacity. This requires improved financing and political framework conditions. However, only around 3% of global energy investment² and less than 2% of global investment in renewable energy currently comes from Africa - despite the fact that 60% of the world's best solar potential is located on the continent³.

Kenya is particularly noteworthy: over 90% of electricity generation there already comes from renewable sources, including geothermal, hydropower, wind and, increasingly, solar⁴. Kenya is also one of the largest recipients of green investments on the continent - in 2023 alone, around 3.3 billion US dollars were invested in renewable energies². The country shows that an almost completely green power supply on African soil is not only possible, but can be a reality.

At the same time, the continent remains highly vulnerable to climate impacts such as droughts, floods and crop failures. This shows that progress and challenges often go hand in hand. Without determined investment in infrastructure, power grids and financing instruments, the great potential is in danger of remaining untapped.

### 5. Culture and Soft Power: Africa’s Global Voice

Africa’s cultural presence is growing: Afrobeats is topping global charts, Highlife’s rhythms are shaping modern pop, and the Kizomba dance and music scene is attracting an ever‑growing worldwide following. Diaspora cultures—such as those in Brazil, where Congolese traditions have shaped Carnival—invigorate global debates on identity and justice.

Diasporas arise when people leave their homelands and form new communities elsewhere. They preserve their cultural roots while spreading African music, spirituality, art and social movements worldwide. Examples include the Afro-Brazilian martial art Capoeira and jazz, strongly influenced by West-African traditions.

Another standout of Africa’s soft power is Nollywood, Nigeria’s film industry. Producing thousands of films per year, Nollywood is the world’s second-largest and shapes pop culture far beyond Africa—projecting African life, fostering identity and strengthening a new generation’s self-confidence.

Carnival parades, film festivals and literary prizes signal a cultural renaissance. Such soft power influences political debates and social narratives worldwide—soft power being the ability to attract and persuade rather than coerce or pay.

Traces of African culture can also be found in the global tech industry: the Linux distribution “Ubuntu”, one of the world's most widely used open source platforms, bears a term from South African philosophy. Ubuntu means “I am because we are” and emphasizes community, responsibility and mutual respect. The fact that an African concept has become a cornerstone of the global developer and innovation scene shows how deeply African cultural values can influence modern technologies.

The Ubuntu philosophy is also increasingly shaping the global corporate and leadership culture. In conjunction with Carol Dweck's concept of the growth mindset - the belief that skills grow through commitment and a willingness to learn - new forms of responsible and community-oriented leadership are emerging. Numerous education and leadership initiatives today combine both: the collaborative spirit of Ubuntu with Dweck's scientifically based motivation theory. These approaches emphasize the joy of learning, a willingness to make mistakes, respectful cooperation and growing together - values that are increasingly regarded as forward-looking both in African companies and internationally. Internationally known concepts such as the Arbinger Institute's “Outward Mindset”, which focuses on a change of perspective, empathy and responsibility, also show clear parallels to the Ubuntu mindset and are becoming increasingly important in the context of modern leadership.

### 6. Structural Challenges and the Way Forward

Despite positive trends, Africa’s path is strewn with hurdles: weak governance, corruption, infrastructure gaps, social inequality and fragile institutions often impede sustainable development.

A pressing issue is economic sovereignty. Sierra Leone’s First Lady, Fatima Maada Bio, notes that even in resource-rich nations, core sectors are foreign-controlled: “Every mining company in Sierra Leone today is owned by a foreigner—even our main dam is run by the British.” Attempts to reclaim resources are often thwarted by powerful international interests, fuelling political instability and limiting national agency.

Bio stresses that without peace there can be no sustainable development. Ongoing conflicts in Sudan, insecurity in the Sahel and waves of violence in the DRC show how armed strife undermines economic growth and erases progress. Peace is thus not just a moral goal but a prerequisite for economic and social advancement.

African governments are responding: Tanzania is renegotiating mining contracts; Ghana is rolling out a national digital ID; and large projects like smart cities are taking shape. Yet the struggle for genuine economic self-determination is tough.

New challenges include: rural internet penetration is just 22 percent; brain drain is significant—around 38 percent of African STEM graduates emigrate; and balancing foreign investment with national sovereignty remains central.

### Conclusion

Africa is no monolith but a continent of contrasts, opportunities and challenges. Its awakening is real—driven by a young, digital-savvy generation, the quest for economic sovereignty and the revival of cultural identity.

Africa’s rise among the world’s fastest-growing economies is impressive and inspiring. But as voices like Fatima Maada Bio caution: true independence is not only political but economic. As long as outsiders control key resources, growth remains fragile. Peace and political stability are the indispensable foundations on which Africa’s future must be built. Africa is not only shaping its future—it is fighting for genuine sovereignty and shared prosperity.
